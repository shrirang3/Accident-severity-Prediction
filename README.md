This projects aims to predict the severity of accident based on multiple factors such as road-type, climate conditions, no. of deaths etc. The basic workflow of this project is:
1. Data Visualization (Data format is csv)
2. Imputations for missing data (mode, mean imputation)
3. One Hot Encoding for Categorical/None-Numeric data
4. Modelling(Creating the model and training)
5. Saving the model (using joblib)
6. Prediction on data (accuracy calculation, ROC, confusion matrix)
7. Explainable AI (shap library)
8. Deployment on Streamlit (cloud)
